# CityPop

This branch contains the version of the application using [ninja-apis city api](https://api-ninjas.com/api/city) for city information.
The api is pretty well documented with clear code examples and delivers axactly the information desired.

Other branches offer the same features but are based on other apis.

Deployed version of this branch is available [here](https://flamboyant-fermi-228f10.netlify.app/)
